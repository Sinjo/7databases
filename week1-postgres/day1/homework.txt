3. MATCH FULL means that a compound foreign key must either have all
   its columns set, or all of them NULL. This is in contrast to MATCH
   SIMPLE, which allows some columns to be NULL while others aren't.

# Do

1. SELECT * FROM pg_class WHERE relname in ('countries', 'cities', 'events', 'venues');

Question: Is this what we were meant to do? Or is there some
          property which identifies that they're tables we
          created?

2. SELECT e.title, c.country_name
   FROM events e JOIN venues
   ON e.venue_id = venues.venue_id JOIN cities
   ON venues.postal_code = cities.postal_code AND venues.country_code = cities.country_code JOIN countries c
   ON cities.country_code = c.country_code
   WHERE e.title LIKE 'LARP Club';

3. ALTER TABLE venues ADD COLUMN active boolean DEFAULT TRUE;
